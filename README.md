# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Project
Requirements for the project

    - Users should be able to view the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size. 
    - Users should be able to see the hover state for all interactive elements on the page.
    - Users should be able to play the game either solo vs the computer or multi player against another person.
    - Users should be able to save the game state in the browser so that it’s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
    - Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it’s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win

How to use the project

    - Basically users can view the optimal layout of the project depending on their device's screen as they click on the link pasted above.
    - To see the hover states for interactive elements, simply move the mouse over the interactive elements such as the social media handles etc.
    - Also, to start the game, users have the choice of playing a solo vs the computer game or a multi player vs another person game.
    - Once the user makes the choice, the game starts where each tries to get a row of three Xs or three Os before the opponent does.
    - A feature in the game allows the user to save the game state in the browser so that it's preserved if the player refreshes their browser.
